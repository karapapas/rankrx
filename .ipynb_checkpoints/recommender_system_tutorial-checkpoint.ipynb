    "### What is a recommendation system?!\n",
    "Online services usually provide thousands, millions or even billions of items like products, video clips, movies, musics, news, articles, blog posts, advertisements, etc. For example, the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store) provides millions of apps and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) provides billions of videos. [[1]](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/recommendation/overview)\n",
    "\n",
    "However, users prefer to see a handful shortlist of likely items instead of struggling with the full corpora. They usually can search or filter the list to find the best handful items, but sometimes they even don't know what they really want (e.g. a birthday gift). In a physical store an expert seller would help in this case by useful recommendations. So, why not in an online store?!\n",
    "\n",
    "A recommedation system can retrieve, filter and recommend best personalized results for the user - results which the user is likely to buy. So it is one of the major requirements of modern businesses in order to increase their `conversion rate`. On September 21, 2009, Netflix gave a grand prize of $1,000,000 to a team which bested Netflix's own algorithm for predicting ratings by 10.06%.

    "A recommendation system ia a system that gives a `query (context)` which is what we know about the liking list, and filter the corpus (full catalog of items) to a shortlist of `candidates` (items, documents). A query (context) can be a combination of ***user id***, ***user's geographical location***, ***user's history of previous purchases***, etc and the resulting candidates can be some new items that we guess are interesting for the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "The query can also be a combination of ***item id***, ***its image***, ***its textual description***, etc and the candidates can be some similar or related items from the corpus.\n",

    "### Recommendation stages (tasks)\n",
    "In practice, dealing with a large corpus and filter it to a shortlist is an intractable and inefficient task. So practical recommender systems has two (or three) filterng phases:\n",
    "1. Retrieval (Candidate Generation)\n",

    "### Content-based Filtering vs Collaborative Filtering\n",
    "Filtering items is based on similarities. we can filter the list based on similar candidates (`content-based filtering`) or based on the similarity between queries and candidates (`collaborative filtering`). Collaborative filtering algorithms usually perform better than content-based methods.\n",

    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Representation of a query or a candidate\n",
    "A query or a candidate has lots of different features. For example a query can be constructed by these features:\n",
    "- user_id\n",
    "- user_previous_history\n",
    "- user_job\n",
    "- etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "And a candidate can have features like:\n",
    "- item_description\n",
    "- item_image\n",
    "- item_price\n",
    "- posted_time\n",
    "- etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "These obviouse features can be `numerical variables`, `categorical variables`, `bitmaps` or `raw texts`. However, these low-level features are not enough for any prediction and we should extract some more abstract `latent features` from these obvious features to represent the query or the candidate as a numerical high-dimensional vector - known as `Embedding Vector`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Matrix Factorization` (MF) is a classic collaborative filtering method to learn some `latent factors` (latent features) from `user_id`, `item_id` and `rating` features and represent **users** and **items** by latent (embedding) vectors.\n",

    "Matrix Factorization method only uses `user_id` and `candidate_id` features collaboratively to learn the `latent features`. In fact it doesn't care about other side-features like `candidate_description`, `price`, `user_comment`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "To involve side-features as well as ids while learning latent features (embeddings), we can use deep neural network (DNN) architectures like `softmax` or `two-tower` neural models.\n",

    "As we can see, the model is `overfitted` on the training dataset. It works well for training data, simply because it memorized them. However, the performance on training data is not important. The model should be able to `generalize` to new unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The overfitting phenomenon is especially strong when models have many parameters. It can be mediated by `model regularization` and use of user and movie features that help the model generalize better to unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, The model is re-recommending some of users' already watched movies. These known-positive watches can crowd out test movies out of top K recommendations and reduce the model accuracy for test data. This can be tackled by excluding previously seen movies from test recommendations in a third stage. This approach is relatively common in the recommender systems literature, but we don't follow it in these tutorials. If not recommending past watches is important, we should expect appropriately specified models to learn this behaviour automatically from past user history and contextual information. Additionally, it is often appropriate to recommend the same item multiple times (say, an evergreen TV series or a regularly purchased item)."
